## How to run

1. Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed on your system
2. Copy the .env.example file, rename to .env and change the content to reflect your setup (e.g. OpenAI API or Ollama Endpoint etc)
3.

```bash
uv run <name_of_script>.py # Replace name with the name of the script you want to run
```

for example:

```bash
uv run llm_example.py
```
